/*
 * First in Java we have class in java 
 * -- Like in every language we have a main class 
 * -- Inside class we have main method - serves as the entry point 
 * 
 * For entry point it looks for a public class with static method with name main and have a string which dont return any value. 
 * 
 * So we write is 
 * public static void main(string[]args){
 * 
 * }
 * 
 * ** Semi colons is mandatory in java ; ( No as python )
 *
